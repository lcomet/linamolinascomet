I am Lina, a Paraguayan working as a Research Associate at the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Department](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/data-science-und-kuenstliche-intelligenz.html) at Fraunhofer FIT.

I am a highly organized, results-oriented person with attention to detail and efficient communication.

My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more semantic interoperable environments on it. Also, I like to investigate how Semantic Web technologies can help industries in different domains to develop solutions to share and understand their data more efficiently and with added value. My experience in different areas of Computer Science helps me to have a broader view and to produce quality results. Moreover, I have a great interest for aesthetic design and functionality at different levels of software development.

At a more personal level, I love music and art in general.
I also love doing yoga, cooking creatively, and going for walks/hikes in nature.
I enjoy a lot reading books and writing. My main interest is to continuously improve myself both professionally and personally.
