I am Lina, a Paraguayan working as a Research Associate at the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Department](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/data-science-und-kuenstliche-intelligenz.html) at Fraunhofer FIT and a PhD Candidate at the [Chair of Databases and Information Systems (i5)](https://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/dbis/) at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/lidx/1/).

My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more semantic interoperable environments on it. I am also interested in investigating how Semantic Web technologies can help industries in different domains to share and understand their data more efficiently.

Moreover, I have a great interest for aesthetic design and functionality at different levels of software development.

At a more personal level, I love music and art in general.
I also love doing yoga, cooking creatively, and going for walks/hikes in nature.
I enjoy a lot reading books and writing. My main interest is to continuously improve myself both professionally and personally.
