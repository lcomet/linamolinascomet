I am Lina, a Paraguayan living and studying in Germany.

My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more interoperable environments on it. I also have a great interest for aesthetic design and functionality at different levels of software development.

At a more personal level, I love to cook and to go for walks in nature. Also, I enjoy reading books and trying to improve myself at a professional and personal level.
