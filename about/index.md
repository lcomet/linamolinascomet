I am Lina, a Paraguayan living and studying in Germany.

My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more interoperable environments on it. I also have a great interest for aesthetic design and functionality at different levels of software development.

At a more personal level, I love music and art in general.
I also love doing yoga, cooking creatively, and going for walks/hikes in nature. 
I enjoy a lot reading books and writing. My main interest is to continuously improve myself both professionally and personally.
