I am Lina, a Paraguayan living and studying in Germany.

My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more interoperable environments on it. I also have a great interest for aesthetic design and functionality at different levels of software development.

At a more personal level, I love music and yoga. I enjoy a lot cooking creatively and going for walks/hikes in nature. I also enjoy reading books and writing, and I am always trying to improve myself at a professional and personal level.
