I am Lina, a Paraguayan living and studying in Germany.
My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more interoperable environments on it.
At a more personal level, I love to cook and to go for a walk in the nature. Also, I enjoy reading books and trying to improve myself at a professional and personal level.
