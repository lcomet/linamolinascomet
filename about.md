<p>Hi, I am Lina! I am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/data-science-und-kuenstliche-intelligenz.html/">Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Department</a> at Fraunhofer FIT.
I am a highly organized, results-oriented person with attention to detail and efficient communication.
</p>

<p>I am currently working on the definition and implementation of Data Spaces. My focus is mainly on Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Data Modelling for Data Spaces. I am interested in research and application aspects related to these topics.
The projects I am involved in are in the areas of Mobility, Industry 4.0, Agriculture, and Culture.
I have participated in the specification of the [IDS Information Model](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/InformationModel/docs/index.html#) and [mobilityDCAT-AP](https://mobilitydcat-ap.github.io/mobilityDCAT-AP/releases/index.html).
My main interests are related to the Web and how to create more semantically interoperable environments on it. In addition, I like to investigate how Semantic Web technologies can help industries from different domains to develop solutions to share and understand their data in a more efficient and value-added way. My experience in different areas of Computer Science helps me to have a broader vision and to produce quality results.
At a more personal level, I love music and art in general.
I also love doing yoga, cooking creatively, and going for walks/hikes in nature.
I enjoy a lot reading books and writing. My main interest is to continuously improve myself both professionally and personally.</p>
